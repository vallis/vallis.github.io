	<div class="span7">
		<p>The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used in gravitational-wave observations
		as the basic figure of merit for detection confidence and, together with the
		Fisher matrix, for the amount of physical information that can be extracted
		from a detected signal. SNRs are usually computed from a sensitivity curve,
		which describes the gravitational-wave amplitude needed by a monochromatic
		source of given frequency to achieve a threshold SNR.</p>

		<p>For interferometric space-based detectors similar to LISA, which are
		sensitive to long-lived signals and have constantly changing position and
		orientation, exact SNRs need to be computed on a source-by-source basis. For
		convenience, most authors prefer to work with sky-averaged sensitivities,
		accepting inaccurate SNRs for individual sources and giving up control over
		the statistical distribution of SNRs for source populations.</p>

		<p>In this paper, we describe a straightforward end-to-end recipe to compute
		the <i>non</i>-sky-averaged sensitivity of interferometric space-based
		detectors of any geometry. This recipe includes the effects of spacecraft
		motion and of seasonal variations in the partially subtracted confusion
		foreground from Galactic binaries, and it can be used to generate a sampling
		distribution of sensitivities for a given source population. In effect, we
		derive <i>error bars</i> for the sky-averaged sensitivity curve, which provide
		a stringent statistical interpretation for previously unqualified statements
		about sky-averaged SNRs.</p>

		<p>As a worked-out example, we consider isotropic and Galactic-disk
		populations of monochromatic sources, as observed with the "classic LISA"
		configuration. We confirm that the (standard) inverse-rms average sensitivity
		for the isotropic population remains the same whether or not the LISA orbits
		are included in the computation. However, detector motion tightens the
		distribution of sensitivities, so for 50% of sources the sensitivity is within
		30% of its average. For the Galactic-disk population, the average and
		distribution of the sensitivity for a moving detector turn out to be similar
		to the isotropic case.</p>
