        <p>Einstein's theory of special relativity is deeply
        connected with the notions of <i>inertial reference frame</i>, and of
        <i>inertial observer</i>; nevertheless, there is a special interest in
        the consideration of accelerated observers, even in a
        special-relativistic context.  First, accelerated frames are
        historically the germ from which general relativity was born; second,
        there are special topics in relativistic theories (such as the
        now-famous Unruh effect and the problem of radiation reaction) where
        we gain physical insight by a subjective description <i>made from the
        point of view of accelerated observers</i>.  In this thesis, we study
        the physics of accelerated observers from several points of
        view.</p>

        <p>First, we identify the origin of the Unruh and Hawking
        effects in the <i>classical</i> principle of <i>perspectival
        semantics</i>, according to which some familiar notions defined in
        special-relativistic theories (such as <i>particle</i> and
        <i>radiation</i>) become blurred when they are transported to
        accelerated frames or to curved spacetimes. We support our claim by
        presenting a classical analogue of the Unruh effect based on the
        noninvariance of the notion of electromagnetic radiation when
        switching from inertial to accelerated observers.  Second, we propose
        a general scheme to build an accelerated system of coordinates
        (<i>M&auml;rzke--Wheeler coordinates</i>) adapted to the motion of a
        generic accelerated observer. These coordinates reduce to Lorentz
        coordinates in a neighborhood of the observer's worldline, and they
        generally provide a smooth and consistent foliation of spacetime into
        spacelike surfaces. We employ M&auml;rzke--Wheeler coordinates to
        clarify the relativistic <i>paradox of the twins</i>, and we suggest
        that field quantization in these coordinates could solve a well-known
        inconsistency in the theory of the <i>circular</i> Unruh effect
        (quantization in rotating coordinates is inconsistent with the
        measurements of a rotating detector).  Finally, we review the
        perennial debate (among relativists and philosophers of physics alike)
        on the conventionality of Einstein simultaneity in special relativity,
        and we find that the evidence for the <i>nonconventionality</i> of
        Einstein synchronization appears very compelling. We extend the
        discussion to accelerated observers in special relativity and we we
        make the case for the conventionality of <i>M&auml;rzke--Wheeler
        simultaneity</i>.</p>
